# Improvement Points

Here are some points that I wish to cover, however due to the time restrictions and the scope of this project, I let them to the other opportunity.

1. Deal with the cases where the user do not enabled the location services. This we can solve having a screen asking the user to enable it or the app will not work.

2. Create a cache system to not overload the weatherApi with to much requests at time. At least having a limit of 1 to 2 minutes between every weather request.

3. Make the app work offline, currently the app only work having a internet connection, together with the cache implementation, this will make this app more robust.
